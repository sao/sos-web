        SOS Crane and Trucking’s primary mission is to create and implement
        practices that result in SOS being the safest transportation company in
        California. SOS is committed to the safety and welfare of all, directly
        and indirectly, involved with SOS.  We aim to achieve Incident Free
        Operation through education and awareness of dangers and risk that are
        present in the workplace.
