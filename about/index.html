      <p>
        SOS Crane was founded in July 1989 in Signal Hill California by Steve
        and Kim Whaley primarily to service the oilfield, construction and
        energy industries in California. The business was expanded in 1995 with
        the addition of a yard facility in Bakersfield. Further growth of the
        Company has resulted in a new Company headquarters and 20-acre yard
        facility with rail access and pipe storage yard on Enos Lane in
        Bakersfield.
