    <h3 class="welcome">Welcome to SOS Crane &amp; Trucking</h3>
    <p class="intro col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
      SOS Crane was founded in July 1989 in Signal Hill California by Steve and
      Kim Whaley primarily to service the oilfield industry in Southern
      California. The business was expanded in 1995 with the addition of a yard
      facility in Bakersfield. Further growth of the Company has resulted in a
      new Company headquarters and 20-acre yard facility with rail access and
      pipe storage yard on Enos Lane in Bakersfield.
